# Metadata manipulation

Small programs to manipulate the metadata downloaded with the Import/Export App of DHIS2.

* `remove_users.py` - Remove users, userAccesses and userGroupAccesses from a metadata export
* `show_expirable_fields.py` - Find programrules, programrulevariables, dataelements and trackedentityattributes. And then print them in order. The idea is so we can compare them pre- and post-import.
* `jcat` - cat on steroids to manipulate json files.
